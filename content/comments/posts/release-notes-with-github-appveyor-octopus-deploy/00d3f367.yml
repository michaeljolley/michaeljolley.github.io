  That's a good point Maks.  I've never experience that issue because I previously worked in a very agile organization where we generated builds nearly daily with a team of 20 people at most.  Those 20 people were actually spread across several projects so we may only have 3-5 people committing to any one repo per day which limited the number of commits to well under 250.



  But certainly, if you're in a less agile or waterfall based development cycle, you'll probably want to look at a different method or, as you mentioned, utilize the git CLI directly to access the commits.
