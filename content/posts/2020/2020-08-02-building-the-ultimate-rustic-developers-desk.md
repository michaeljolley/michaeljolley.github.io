In 20 years of being a developer, I've used lots of various desk types: sitting; stand only; sit/stand; metal; wood. Each had its' pros & cons. But since I've started doing woodworking, I've always wanted to build a desk that fits me. So welcome to my journey to build my ultimate developer desk.

<!--more-->

The reason I say "my" ultimate developer desk, is because we all have our own preferences to how we work best. Over the years I've found a few things that I prefer in my desk:

### Length Over Depth

My arms aren't really long so I prefer a desk that isn't as deep. I like to be able to reach the back of my desk without a lot of reaching. However, I love having a long desk so I can put more on it without cramping my work area. So after taking some measurements of my current desk I finalized on a size of 7' (1.82m) x 27.5" (698.5mm). This depth was also partially determined because I had decided to build with 2x6 boards. In the US, 2x6 boards have an actual size of 1.5"x5.5". So 5 boards would naturally create my depth without the need for cuts.

### Strength for Mountings

Previously, I had 3 24" monitors mounted to the wall behind my desk. I'm moving these to mounts on the desk itself so I can raise & lower it easier. Also, I recently purchased a new computer and want it on the desk rather than underneath. It's a behemoth at nearly 50 pounds (22.6kg) and will sit near the edge of the desk so strength will be important.

### Technical Conveniences

I'm a stickler for good cable management so it would be nice to include some way to manage cables within the desk that makes things look tidy. Also, the correct number of USB ports is always n+1 so I want to integrate a USB hub into the desk, ideally mounted flush with the desktop, so I can always have a spot to plug in something quick.

Finally, I don't want to use a cable to charge my phone. That's so 2018. I want to integrate a wireless charger, maybe under the desk, so I can just set my phone in a specific area on the desktop to charge it while I work.

### Motorized Sit/Stand Capabilities

I've been spoiled in the past by the Ikea sit/stand desk and want that convenience again. I'm currently using a sit/stand desk but it's a very manual transition between those states so I want to automate it. Also, the monitors being mounted on the wall limits my current sit/stand flexibility so those are going to come to the desk.

### Worn & Rustic Aesthetic

I'm not sure I know the correct name for the design/style/whatever of my office. There's lots of wood, iron pipe, a ship-lap wall, and overall "rustic/industrial" vibe so I don't want a perfectly shaped & polished desk. Hopefully, I can build something that looks a little worn and old.

## Tools & Material

I'm writing this after the fact so I can make sure the tools are up-to-date. In all I used:

### Materials

- 5 2"x4"x8" pine boards
- 16 2" screws
- 10-ish 1" screws
- 1 quart [Minwax Espresso Wood Stain](https://amzn.to/3glIXVe)
- 1 quart [Minwax Polycrylic Matte Finish](https://amzn.to/3i58VMT)

### Tools Used

- Measuring tape
- Speed square
- Power drill driver
- Power impact drill
- Random orbit sander
- Various clamps (12-30" (304-762mm))
- Miter saw (but any saw will do)
- Kreg pocket-hole jig (Planned to use a biscuit joiner, but forgot I had one)
- Foam brush (for stain & poly)
- Couple of rags

## Measuring & Measuring & Cutting

 alt="Two inch blocks sitting beside a miter saw that have been cut from the ends of two by sixes" class="right"> First up was cutting the boards to length. Because the ends of store-bought boards aren't always straight, I first cut 2" (50mm) off one end of each. Then I measured and marked the boards 7' (1.82m) from the straight end.

Rather than measure and mark each one, I had previously created a quick square jig on my table stop with two scrap pieces of wood. So I measured, marked and cut the first board. For subsequent boards I squared it with the jig and laid the cut board on top to mark the cut line. This made sure all boards were the same length and saved the time of measuring each board by hand. With each board cut to length, I was ready to glue them together.

If you want a perfectly flat top with no cracks between boards, you need to use a planer and jointer on each board to ensure they are identical. I really want a more rustic look so I don't want the boards perfectly flat/straight/even. I painstakingly checked the boards at the store for any warping or twists and was able to get some really straight boards that meshed well together.

## Stuck On You

Before I started the glue up, I clamped a scrap board to my table that I knew was straight. Then I lined each board against it and reviewed how each board fit with those around it and compared their uniqueness to decide which boards should be in the front versus the back. Once I got each laid out where I liked them, I made some markings to add some pocket screws for stability.

> I had originally planned to use glue and biscuits to align the boards, but when I got to the glue up I forgot that I had the biscuits and a plate joiner. Because, you know... I'm a winner.

Once the marks were in place, I used my pocket-hole jig to create holes for the screws. Once they were all pre-drilled I glued the boards and quickly aligned and screwed them together to help hold them in place while the glue dried. The glue will provide more than enough strength to hold them together. The screws were more helpful for holding them while I worked and before I could clamp them all together.

Once the glue and screws were in place, I added clamps on both sides of the board to help ensure good contact across the boards and left them to dry for a day.

## Sanding, Sanding & More Sanding

I was really messy in my glue-up. I didn't bother to clean the joints between the boards or any runs. That meant we were going to do more sanding than we probably needed. So I spent a couple days sanding the entire desk starting with 240 grit and working my way down to 80 grit.

## Let's Be Extra

Hi. My name is Michael and I'm extra. I'm the guy who was being interviewed for a job and suggested they hire me because I have an animatronic puppet that would be great to control with their product. I hear the best way to overcome your issues is to first admit you have the problem. So I can't just build a desk. I've got to figure out had to add something to it.

> Looking back I seriously have a problem. Before this project I had never stained wood, used polycrylic or built a desk. Heck, the little routing I had done was to make a hole for a battery pack for a LED strip mounted behind a guitar hanging on my wall. Why I thought I could do any of this, much less the complex routing required for the USB hub, is beyond me.
