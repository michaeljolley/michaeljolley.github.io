When I started writing for this blog a few years ago, I was overwhelmed at the plethora of platforms available to me. .NET? Got it. JavaScript? Sure. Ruby? You know it! While I settled on Jekyll, it was somewhat by accident. I really liked the idea of writing my posts in Markdown with GitHub Pages and, since they were powered by Jekyll, the choice was made for me.

Since then many of those platforms have gone the way of the buffalo. But it seems that just as one dies off, another takes its place. Now we have options for every language and framework you might want. You're an Angular developer? You might feel comfortable with [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully). More of a React dev? [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is probably more up your alley.

I've been developing with Vue.js for a while, so [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) seemed like a better fit for me. So a few months ago I made the transition and have loved every minute of it.
