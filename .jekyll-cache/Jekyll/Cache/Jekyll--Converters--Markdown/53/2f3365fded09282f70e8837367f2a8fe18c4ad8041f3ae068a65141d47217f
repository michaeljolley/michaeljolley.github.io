<p>(To the tune of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)</p>

<p>Now, this is a story all about how<br />
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br />
And Iâ€™d like to take a minute<br />
Just sit right back<br />
Iâ€™ll tell you how I became a dev for the full stack</p>

<p>In east Alabama born and raised<br />
On the Compaq was where I spent most of my days<br />
Chillinâ€™ out maxinâ€™ chattinâ€™ all cool<br />
Dialed up to AOL, logged in after school</p>

<p>Then some HTML when I was up really late<br />
Started showing gifs that would animate<br />
I made one little page and my momâ€™s voice raised<br />
She said â€˜You better use those tabs and stop with the spacesâ€™</p>
